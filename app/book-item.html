                <strong>Open content film</strong> <br />
                Main article: Open content film An open content film is much
                like an independent film, but it is produced through open
                collaborations; its source material is available under a license
                which is permissive enough to allow other parties to create fan
                fiction or derivative works, than a traditional copyright. Like
                independent filmmaking, open source filmmaking takes place
                outside Hollywood, or other major studio systems.<br />
                <strong>Fan film</strong> <br />
                Main article: Fan film A fan film is a film or video inspired by
                a film, television program, comic book or a similar source,
                created by fans rather than by the source's copyright holders or
                creators. Fan filmmakers have traditionally been amateurs, but
                some of the most notable films have actually been produced by
                professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as
                demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in length, from
                short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to
                rarer full-length motion pictures.
